# DynamicNotch

DynamicNotch is a macOS application inspired by the Dynamic Island feature on iPhone 15 models. It extends the functionality of the MacBook's notch by providing dynamic animations and notifications for various system events such as battery charging and AirPods connection.

## Features

- **Dynamic Charging Animation:** Displays an animation when the MacBook is plugged in or unplugged, showing the current battery status and charging status.
- **AirPods Connection Animation:** Shows an animation when AirPods are connected, displaying their battery levels and connection status.
- **Runs in the Background:** The app runs in the background without displaying an icon in the dock.

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement dynamic charging animation
- [ ] Improve AirPods connection detection and battery level fetching
- [ ] Add more system event animations (e.g., Wi-Fi connection, Bluetooth devices)
- [ ] Customizable animations and themes
- [ ] User preferences for enabling/disabling specific animations
